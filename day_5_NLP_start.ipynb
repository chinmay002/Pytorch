We also always tip a dollar to our cashier, but this time I didn't want to tip our cashier anything because the scoops she gave us was very very TINY! When we sat down to eat our ice cream, I've noticed that my creole cream cheese ice cream was very sour. We informed our cashier about it and she offered to change it with a different flavor. I am not a big fan of the other flavors they have because all of them are super sweet. So I told her it is ok, no big deal. I didn't eat or finish my ice cream after that for fearing of getting diarrhea or food poisoning later. I really think that the milk or cream cheese used in that particular batch probably expired already for it to be that sour! Yuck! I just left the ice cream on my table. Later on I've decided to get a new one in my husband's favorite flavor instead of wasting my money. Our cashier was willing to get us a new one, but the look on her face was filled with attitude. No smile, no apologies, no nothing. Later she came to our table and handed us the ice cream. I didn't look at her face, but my husband said that she looked at us in disgust like we are one of those people who make up a million excuses to complain and get free complimentary stuff. We are regular customers here and never return back any item purchased. Just this one visit, my ice cream tasted super sour and rotten. That's it! I really love the creole cream cheese ice cream here. It is one of my favorites of all time, but I don't think I will come back due to this unpleasant experience.\",\n",

I went there with a few of my friends to see a concert and, fish, and catch up.  We went to the concert on a Saturday night and were out quite late.  The next morning my friend noticed that there was a business card on his dresser that he must not have noticed the night before.  The business card was from an escort!  On the back of the card there was a note that read, \"Thanks for getting me out in the rain for nothing.  You should have canceled.\"  We can only deduce that some \"John\" staying at the hotel gave her the wrong room number or she was in the wrong wing of the hotel.  This must have happened while we were at the concert.  Since my friend was staying in his room alone either a hotel employee let her in or the front desk clerk gave her a key.  The hotel security is going to pull the hall surveillance tapes and do a key lock audit and let my friend know what happened.  Bottom line is that the hotel let an escort into my friend\\'s room while we were out.  Luckily he had put his computer and cash into the room safe or I think he would have been robbed.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the stay at the the hotel and everything seemed good except for this incident, but this is a pretty big incident.  I also have to say that the hotel security staff was cynical and even went so far as to ask my friend if he had visited any \"Gentlemen\\'s Clubs\" that evening.  It was pretty rude and we didn\\'t care for his insinuations.  I certainly hope that after the hotel concludes their investigation they have a good explanation and are forthcoming with an apology to my friend.\\n\\nIn any case, I\\'ve learned an important lesson.  Always use your room safe.\\n\\nPS - after the investigation is complete, I\\'ll update this review.',\n",

The avocado, egg white, and spinach sandwich was fine.  Nothing to comment there.  Coffee was a different story.  First off, I was given a paper cup.  I did a double-take and thought maybe she heard me say 'hot coffee' instead.  I checked the receipt and it did indeed say 'iced coffee.'  That's fine, no biggie.  I got a little bit of ice and filled up with iced coffee.  I took and sip and thought I was drinking water mildly flavored with coffee.  I thought maybe I added too much ice, though in retrospect, not enough time had elapsed for much melting to occur.  I poured it out and filled up with just the iced coffee.  Same thing.  Okay, maybe that's why I was given a paper cup - because I was going to be forced to go with hot coffee instead.\\n\\nMost Panera's I've been do have a nice spread of coffee.  This one had decaf, light roast, dark roast, and hazelnut.  Not a great selection, but it would do.  I went with hazelnut.  Nothing...  Fine, I went with the dark roast.  I found a worker to report the two issues - iced coffee that tasted like water and hazelnut coffee being out.  Five minutes later, on my way out, I noticed that there was a sign on the hazelnut coffee, which I imagine said it was out.

We debated going to Cafe Alfresco, but I wanted to try the salad bar. The hostess (owner/manager) greeted us at the door. I am curious if the person at the hostess stand is an owner or a manager. The waitress was prompt. I was debating between the fried chicken or the 10 oz. NY strip that was on special. My father ordered the steak and because I haven\\'t eaten a steak in probably 9 months so did I. There was nothing special about it. We both ordered med rare. The steaks were extremely tough and chewy. The strips were unseasoned and tasteless. I was just going to just suffer through it because I\\'ve worked off and on in the restaurant business for twenty years. My father really had a hard time cutting his steak. He commented to the waitress three times that our steaks were tough and chewy. She listened, said \" I\\'m sorry\" and walked away. At one point while trying to cut through my dad\\'s tough steak his cheap fork completely bent. We had a good laugh. He called the waitress over and showed her his fork. She just laughed. I then asked her to get my father a new fork, before she walked away. My father did tell the waitress that he would eat the steak because he felt like he was taking it out on her. It was obvious we weren\\'t happy. They didn\\'t care. I asked the waitress is the 10 oz . NY strip the same as the other strips. She said yes and that they cut the steaks there. Terrible.

Our appetizer, which tastes the best when it first comes out, got cold because the sauce was not served with it right away.  The food itself is ok but  nothing to rave around.    I actually saw a table leave the last time because it took so long to get any attention.  I've been to many Japanese Sushi Restaurants and this is probably one of the worse experiences.

Very eager for us to sit . There was a sign of the breakfast specials and a breakfast menu that was brought to us . The menu was one sided single menu with few options . I ordered the Pumpkin pancake special with eggs and sausage . My husband ordered the 2 eggs with toast which came with potatoes. As we sat we noticed that the restaurant next door , ( it was so close that I thought it was all one place) there was a line of people waiting to sit over there . I should have known that was a clear clue to get in line over there . The breakfast arrived to the table next to us ,  2 eggs , toast and sliced tomatos . The toast was a 1/2 inch thick by 4 inch x 1 inch wide piece of bread toasted . I swear , it was literally 2 bites of toast . Now our breakfast arrives , I had ordered my eggs scrambled with cheese . The pumpkin pancakes with about 4 inch round and just ok, sort of doughy .. my eggs were the fake eggs with barely any cheese . The sausage was 2 brown and serve links , I recognise the stuff as I buy it .  My husbands eggs were real , he had them cooked over medium . His potatoes were served room temp... and very small portion . I looked to be about 1/3 of a cup if that . His toast was the same as served at the table next to us . 1/2 inch thick , 4 inch long by 1 inch wide . Literally 2 bites of toast .  No butter on it so my husband asked for butter and jelly , she brought the butter which was a few cut chunks of butter cut off a stick of butter  and the jelly was a pepper jelly . She said that is the ONLY jelly that they have . I fully see why there was a line waiting NEXT door . We also had 2 cups of coffee .... our breakfast cost $18 . I was waiting for our server to ask how our breakfast was ... no one asked how we liked it . Its not that it was any one thing that was just not right , the whole experience as a whole was just wrong .\\n\\nPLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU LOOK ON THEIR WEB SITE THERE IS NOT AN EMAIL ONLY A PHONE NUMBER .',\n",

I thought that this \"reputable\" Day Spa would be a great way to treat her to a prenatal massage.  I booked a week in advance and was told on the phone as well as read online that clients are asked to arrive AT LEAST 15 minutes prior to their appointments. This early arrival is requested so that you may get paperwork completed, change clothes and enjoy time in the quiet room to unwind and relax. We each had an appointment for 9:00 am on a Friday, one deep tissue and one prenatal.  We arrived by taxi at 8:45am, only to find the spa still closed and no employees inside.  The first employee arrived around 9:05 and then showed us to the changing room.  The shower drain had a mass of hair in it from the previous day, trashcans were over flowing onto the bathroom floor, and wilted (once pretty) flowers sat in vases along the vanity counter.  Once dressed, we made our way to the quiet room.  The receptionist then came in at 9:15 and said that one of our massuses was running a few minutes late.  We kept quiet and figured we\\'d give her the benefit of the doubt... traffic, rough morning, sick child maybe. To make this short... our massages both were cut short due to spa not being prepared for business and not having their employees arrive on time.

I sat down and the nail technician asked me what shape I would like so I told her not to square just some slightly rounded out edges. She asked me \"so Oval?\" I said \"sure something like that\" she processed to start on my nails she had done all but put the acrylic overlay and paint on before talking to what I assume is the owner or was the manager for the day spoke to her in a language I couldn\\'t understand all I could make out was then saying \"oval\" a lot before the owner/manager turned to me and said that\\'s gunna be another $5 for any shape that isn\\'t square. I was beyond confused and questioned why when I\\'m almost done with the manicure is she saying I have to pay extra now? She said \"that\\'s just how it is\" I tried explaining to her that it wasn\\'t right especially when I asked two times both in phone and in person and the information was not relayed let alone even anywhere in the store she angrily replied with \"we have pamphlets we leave in the front of the store with prices\" I tried explaining to her once again that there are no prices over there she cut me off and said \"do you want me to just take the nails off and you can go?\" I told her I can\\'t necessarily leave the nail salon with damaged nails and she said still angry and with an attitude \"no it won\\'t be damaged I take it off good\" mind you my nails have already been filed and shaved down with nail glue and extensions on already. At this point I kept trying to explain to her they will still be damaged from the glue, filing, and shaving and she just kept cutting me off, giving me an attitude, and trying to push me out the door. my anxiety was starting to rise through the roof my partner actually had to step in and explain to her everything I was trying to say to which after awhile of hearing my partner and seeing me slowly going through an anxiety attack that was slowly escalating to a panic attack she just said \"it\\'s fine I\\'ll do it\" like this was some big burden for her. She walked to the front saw no pamphlets walked all the way to the back to bring some to the front. My partner picked up the pamphlet and showed me once we left that nowhere  n the pamphlet did it say they charge for nail shape it was says the base price with a plus sign next to it.... if you ask me that\\'s way too open ended especially when no over nail salon charges for nail shape unless it\\'s cat claw and that\\'s only very few salons.

The ambiance is dated, the bar area looks dismal and uninviting.   Take a look at the floor, it is really time for a face lift. The main dining area is dim but not like you would expect in a nicer fine dining restaurant.   I\\'m not expecting a Michelin quality dining experience, but I am in awe of how Tucson is raving about the food here. Again, I guess in Tucson expectations are generally low as there is nothing better to compare to, in food, and in the arts.  The french onion soup had onions that were inedible (the skin part) and the flavor was not rich and full, too watery. The mussel dish was not fresh and overcooked. The scallops had a slight ammonia smell to it and it was chewy. The potatoes were covered and smothered in oil. I think the food here might be best suited in a retirement community, which it seems like it is given the fact that everyone in the restaurant seems to be well over their 60s.  The service however was excellent. I almost feel the vibe that the waiters feel bad about the quality of food (and the price for which they are set at ) they are serving and hopefully their tables are unsuspecting customers who do not have a (semi-)sophisticated palate.',\n",

So, I send in emails and call. I get a call back a couple days later saying \"we got the other size doors from the manufacturer, but they didn\\'t exactly match the original doors. We didn\\'t know what to do.\" \\n\\nTHEY GOT THE DOORS AND DIDN\"T KNOW WHAT TO DO!?

       " {'text': 'I liked this place so much last time that I raved about it to all of my friends and came here again with a group of them. What a shame that this weekend\\'s experience was both disappointing and embarrassing. \\n\\nI had made a reservation, which turned out to be a good idea because they were pretty busy. In the reservation, we had asked for an outdoor table. The hostess had reserved us an indoor table. We told her that we were willing to wait for an outdoor table to give the server some time, if he had been seated recently. While the hostess was reluctantly figuring out whether to give us an outdoor table, an older lady (maybe a manager?) came over and took us to an outdoor table. \\n\\nOur server was reasonably good. He frequently checked in on us. However, our water glasses remained empty for long stretches of time. When we were ready to order, the older lady who seated us came to take our order instead of our server. \\n\\nWe ordered 3 items for starters: the Dan Dan noodles, Crispy Rice Style Pork, and the Bok Choy vegetable dish, to which the older lady said, \"THAT\\'S IT?!?!\" followed by, \"THAT\\'S ALL YOU WANT TO ORDER???\"  all in a very rude tone and incredulous facial expression. I almost choked. \\n\\nAs someone with many years in the restaurant industry, I understand  why one would prefer dining guests to order more. However, I did emphasize that we wanted to order those items as starters. Most restaurants don\\'t have a problem with this. Also, even if I ever thought that a guest ordered too little, (I might secretly curse them out in my head, but) I would NEVER say it to the guest. \\n\\nAlso, as many reviewers point out, the portions are fairly large. I\\'m not  a hugely large eater and I don\\'t think it\\'s wrong to order a comfortable amount of food when dining at a restaurant. (We were still very full by the time we left.) The way the older lady reacted when taking our order was tacky and unprofessional, but the real disappointment was that it took over an hour for our orders to arrive (last time, it took only 10 min). It seemed like she \"forgot\" to give the kitchen our order... maybe because she thought we didn\\'t order enough. \\n\\nAfter 45 minutes, we asked our server about our food. He promptly went to the kitchen and came back saying the food was on its way. 15 minutes later, we asked him again. He checked with the kitchen and said that they had run out of bowls. At the same time, a table of 3 just got seated near us. About 10 minutes later, that table of 3 received an order of Dan Dan noodles (in a bowl!) despite the kitchen\\'s alleged lack of bowls. We still did not receive any of our items... not even the boiled vegetable side dish, which takes about 5 minutes to make. \\n\\nA few minutes later, a manager came out with yet another bowl of Dan Dan noodles, but he offered it to a couple who said they didn\\'t order it. The bowl was sent back to the kitchen, though I suspected that it had been ours. I thought about lunging for it, but it disappeared before I could even blink. Another few minutes later, I talked to a girl who was checking on tables and got her to finally bring out our dishes. She apologized that our food \"took so long to arrive\" ... meaning 1.5 hrs in this case. My friends were really hungry (that\\'s how they kept track of the exact time). I felt so badly about telling them how good Han Dynasty was. \\n\\nThis experience really deserves 1 star, but I\\'m giving 2 stars after taking my last visit into account. I believe the bad reviews a bit more now. I\\'m not sure if I can still recommend this place at the risk of having others wait 1.5hrs for their food and get rude service from that older lady (the hostess/manager/person who took down our order). We didn\\'t ask for a discount, but if this happens to you, make sure you get yours.',\n",

This time the appetizers were all in stock, and the only thing they were out of was sweet potato fries - not a big deal. \\n\\nWe ordered the charcuterie plate and the brussels sprouts for appetizers and they were both great. The only critique I had is that the charcuterie plate came with three cheeses, two meats, and only five small pieces of bread. We immediately asked for more bread, but didn't receive it until our group had eaten 95% of the platter.\\n\\nI was again disappointed in the dinner. Of the 6 entrees on the menu, four were seafood, one was lamb, and one was beef. Two of us ordered the exact same thing - the 6 ounce beef filet, done medium. One of us received medium, while I received well done. This is twice I've received well done when ordering medium. \\n\\nAnother member of our party ordered the Depot burger, and didn't receive it until 20 minutes after the rest of our food was brought out, despite everyone ordering at the same time. We made it known that it was unacceptable for him to have to sit there for twenty minutes, while the rest of us had been served. We were finished with our meals by the time his food arrived. I don't know if this was an issue with the kitchen, or with our order not being put in correctly, but I will note that our server wrote nothing down. \\n\\nThe only saving grace for this place is their bar, with their refreshing and delicious cocktails. Everyone was pleased with their selections, and multiple rounds were ordered.

Not the way to make a good impression when you have Birra, Brigantessa, Stogie Joe's and Marra's all within short walking distance.  Not to mention almost every pie that we ordered was burnt on the bottom.  The sauce and cheese were decent, but the crust just had that unmistakeable frozen quality to it.  \\n\\n2.

We mentioned our biggest concern was that others might use the hot tub and have the same experience.\\nThe manager contacted me by phone the next day.  He asked the value of the items damaged and I gave him an estimate ($200).  He advised me that amount was too high for him to take action and that he would forward it to the claims department.  \\nThe claims person called later in the week and left a voice mail that he was working on our \"case\".  Later in the week he left another voice mail saying he contacted the hotel and reviewed the log of the readings from the hot tub and they were normal so there was nothing he could do. I called him back to ask why he didn\\'t talk to the employee we showed the suits to? (Dye was dripping on the lobby floor as we stood there in front of her.)  or why he didn\\'t speak with me?  We had pictures from the hotel with the suits dripping dye into the tub.  When I brought this to his attention, he told me I could send them but I would have to mail him the damaged suits and ring as well as receipts for the suits (who keeps receipts for bathing suits?)  Once he had all that then he would see what he can do.\\nThis was an amazingly poor experience.   Neither the manager nor the claims person apologized and the claims person essentially called me a liar because the hotel log said the hot tub was okay.  The tub was clearly not normal which makes me feel the hotel lied about that and making us find receipts and mail bathing suits to him is just a way to make it difficult for us to be reimbursed. So......\\nDear Marriott:  KEEP YOUR MONEY!  This experience leads me to believe there is a culture issue and not just a few poor employees.  I travel 150K miles per year and won\\'t be using any of your hotels ever again and I\\'ll be passing my experience onto my co-workers who travel at that same level.  I hope saving that money was worth it.  \\nFor future reference try this: \\n1. Empower the night desk person to resolve issues immediately.  The woman working there could clearly see there was an issue.  It would have been resolved right then had she been empowered to offer a free night or even a free breakfast.  Your process wasted your time as well as mine.\\n2. Some management training.  How did someone get into management in the hospitality industry without knowing to apologize when someone has a bad experience?  The claims person was worse.  Clearly his mandate was to find a reason not to resolve our issue.\\n3. Hire people with character.  You can\\'t possibly tell me that hot tub was within normal parameters when it did what it did in fifteen minutes.  Someone lied.  That\\'s embarrassing.\\n\\nTake care.  See you at the Hyatt.\\n\\nKevin',\n",

It was more out of the way, but with decent prices and a solid reputation, I thought I would be in good hands. So I took my car there today to see about a noise that was coming from the right rear of the car. It was my understanding that they would drive my car, hear the noise, and diagnose the problem. I also mentioned to them that I thought my brakes were starting to go bad so I\\'d like them to check those too. About 2 hours after dropping my car off, they called to tell me that my brakes needed to be done and the front rotors replaced and that is what was causing my noise. I was immediately taken aback, the noise was not coming from my front brakes / rotors. The lady was very dismissive with me on the phone when I questioned it, so I just decided to go and get my car. When I got there, the lady who had initially helped me was busy, one of the other guys said he would help me, but he couldn\\'t find the paperwork and apparently couldn\\'t look us up in the system. So we waited and waited and waited. Finally someone else offered to help he asked her for our paperwork and she snapped at him saying she was helping someone else. He then offered to look and see if he could get it in the system. She walked over and interrupted him which forced my husband to blurt out \"can we just get the keys to the car?\". Here\\'s the kicker... My keys were in the ignition, windows completely rolled down, parked unoccupied in front of the dealership for anyone to just take. Anyway while talking with the guy and him telling me basically the same thing the lady told me, it became very apparent that no one had even driven my car to see what was wrong with it. They didn\\'t even take the tires off to look at the brakes. They didn\\'t do anything! And they wanted to charge me $50 for a diagnostic fee! I\\'m completely appalled by the unprofessional service demonstrated today and the blatant lack of supervision my car received while in their care. Good prices are not always the best prices and I learned a very good lesson today about where I should take my business from now on.\\n\\n\\nUPDATE 7/8/2016: Got my car fixed today thanks to a mechanic friend of mine. Guess what the problem was? My back brakes needed to be replaced. That\\'s it! Got my brakes replaced, noise is gone, and I didn\\'t have to shell out the $800+ that was quoted to me to have my rotors replaced. My rotors we\\'re fine by the way. Oh, and all of this would have been noticed during the free 21 point inspection that comes standard with every oil change, had they actually done the inspection at my previous oil change visit! They really dropped the ball with me, and lost a customer because of it. I\\'ll never bring my car here again.',\n",

We weren\\'t even close to being done.\\n-She didn\\'t ask if we wanted our check split and when we asked her to split it she said she couldn\\'t because it wasn\\'t their policy.

She then preceded to throw the book down on the table, say we needed to hurry up and leave because she needed the table.\\n\\nNever have I had a manager/owner be so rude and tactless.

My wife was paying $10 for this salad. Living here in St. Pete...EVERYONE knows tilapia is one of the most inexpensive cuts of fish in the industry.

My arm is still tired from having to saw my way through this tough leathery piece of meat. \\n\\nMy wife ordered the scallops w/ pork belly. The scallops came from the sea and tasted like the sea. If you\\'ve ever gone on vacation to the ocean and inadvertently opened your mouth letting in salt water that\\'s what the scallops tasted like. If you\\'re like me or any other non native to salt water animal you usually puke a little in your mouth after inhaling the salt water. Other than that sensation in eating the scallops they were great. The side of pork belly was rubbery with a hard crusted plastic like exterior. It was tasteless but now I know what eating a tide pod feels like.\\n\\nOn to the dessert. A chocolate ganache pudding with roasted marshmallows that had to be good, right? You can\\'t screw up chocolate, can you The Block. Well, I\\'m here to tell you that the Block did the unthinkable and screwed up a chocolate dessert. The \"pudding\" was a hard gritty piece of chocolate that we had to use all our strength to chisel away at much the same way John Rambo had to chisel away aimlessly at limestone while he was in the prison work camp at the beginning of Rambo First Blood: Part II. \\n\\nWhen my wife and I left and got in the car there was stunned silence. Finally she broke the silence by berating me, \"you should\\'ve spoke up, you should\\'ve said something when your friends decided on that place.\" A nice emasculation to cap a wonderful $150 meal. \\n\\nMy first piece of advice for The Block would be to close and save the good hard working citizens of St. Louis the time and money. The Rams skipping town, Ferguson/Stockley verdict riots, decaying riverfront, highest murder rate in the nation, this restaurant, we\\'ve been through enough. Failing that advice The Block should change their theme to more of a prison type atmosphere that\\'s more indicative of the food they serve. The waiter is your warden for the night and each table should have a poster of either Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe or Raquel Welch hanging over it. The you know what you have to crawl through to get to the other side is actually eating their food. After you leave the restaurant you get whisked away to a beach in Mexico where you and a smiling Morgan Freeman meet and hug, knowing you\\'ll never have to eat at The Block again.\\n\\nIn the words of Pete Townsend and the voice of Roger Daltrey, \"We don\\'t get fooled again, no no!\"',\n",

The ketchup was empty and the soda machine nozzle must have been dirty as it sprayed inside and outside of the cup. Was there a napkin nearby to clean up? No, those containers were empty too. Lastly, my wife\\'s grilled chicken sandwich was not completely cooked. The one good thing that happened was they replaced her sandwich with another (without an apology).

Miami style.) I know plenty of places in Tampa to get an authentic Tampa-style Cuban (there is a difference!), and I usually hit several every time I\\'m in the area.

Might give it three stars alone.\\n\\nThe Cuban was made properly for a Tampa-style sandwich. The bread was from a local Cuban bakery. I think they toasted it dry so it wasn\\'t quite as good as I\\'m used to, but it was OK. The problem was the amount of ingredients. I think there was one slice of everything, except maybe the salami, which was in one layer only. I am used to these sandwiches being well-stuffed, so I was definitely disappointed. (There is another Cuban shop literally not one block away that would blow this place away, plus they have great black bean soup. We should have gone there. Within a half mile, I can think of two or three other places that are all way better.)  The damage: over $20 for two sandwiches and two medium fountain drinks.\\n\\nSo, #1 Cuban? I think not.\\n\\nSome additional comments added 27 April:\\n\\nAfter re-reading my review, as well as several other accurate ones, I think I may see the problem. Larry\\'s claims \"Just voted #1 Cuban Sub in Tampa\". Is there really any place in Tampa that refers to their Cuban Sandwich as a CUBAN SUB? I can\\'t think of any, not even Publix!

After a 2nd try and a 2nd chance for this much hyped Phila phenomenon, I swear to myself as well as to those I know - I have given it too many chances and will never return!!\\n\\nWhat is so BAD about this place? Briefly, food and service are the main problem. Otherwise it is fine if you like the kind of food they call Chinese or Szechuan, which seems to me didn\\'t even undergo cooking. It is basically just all pre-cooked stuff, vegetables and noodles (mushy, BTW) etc, overdosed with whatever sauce (spicy and greasy, sweet and/or nutty etc..) before served to you. Let me explain in detail..\\n\\nFirst the food. Well, it is food and kinda of edible, I agree that much, but not much more. We ordered the cold & spicy cucumber, which should be a super cheap and served cold so it\\'s commonly a summer dish. It is usually made with crunchy fresh cucumbers, which are plentiful in the summer. The key to this dish is that the kind of cucumbers makes a huge difference. It has to be the flavorful Asian variety which are also dark green colored outside with very small to none seeds. English cucumber would be a closest substitution. The regular large, thick skinned, and tasteless variety with large and mature seeds, and are easily found at the supermarket here in this country simply would not serve the purpose. OK, just what I suspected, we were served with a bowl of this far inferior variety of cucumbers. Not only that, it is not EVEN \"cooked\". By \"cooked\" I mean this dish needs to be tossed with just the right amount of fresh chilly oil and freshly crushed garlic, a dash of Szechuan paper, the right level of sugar and salt, and that is all there is to it. Instead, the normally dark green skinned cucumber dish sitting in front of us is, ok, large, pale (peeled) tasteless cucumber cubes swimming in some sort of light brown gooey sauce. I braved myself with some of the saucy cubes, and they tasted way too sweet! And the sauce is, umm, some sort of peanut based, is my best guess. \\n\\nAnother simple cold dish - Dan Dan Noodles came way too mushy, clearly pre-cooked and sitting way too long to be ordered. It once again came with sweet sesame based sauce. Aside from being overly sweet, the main problem with this dish is the texture of the noodles. We might just like them better if we didn\\'t still have nice and youthful chewing capability...\\n\\nI began to get suspicious about whether they actually do cook the dishes per customers\\' order or if they simply just combine the ingredient with what else... a sauce before serving.. The much raved mapo tofu might be a good indicator, I thought. Sure enough, it came overwhelmed with grease and a kind of spicy sauce. The tofu looked just like any other packaged stuff one can get at an Asian grocery store, nothing special. Just as I suspected, the dish was lukewarm, suggesting it was NOT freshly COOKED in a sizzling hot wok as most Chinese food should be.\\n\\nI could just go on and on with the remaining dishes we ordered - all came to us by the same cooking method, I could tell, which is NO COOKING - pre-cook all the main ingredients, then toss in generous amount of sweet, spicy and/or nutty sauce before serving. The price? yes, the price is about 20-30% higher than a similar dish in just about any Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.\\n\\nLastly, the service was so dismal that I didn\\'t think they deserve any tip for the pretty much non-existent \"service\". We had to beg for water, for example. \\n\\nEnough due credit already given to this non-deserving, over-priced, over-hyped, poor service sauce factory.. or you could call it a \\'restaurant\\' if all it does is to produce the sweet and spicy sauces.',\n",

Here are a few lines from some of the more glowing reviews:\\n\\n\"He doesn\\'t act like a typical car salesman.\"\\n\\n\"I never feel like they are giving me a sell-job\"\\n\\n \"I was dreading the thought of purchasing a car. The experience I had here was refreshing. My salesperson Ali was very courteous and did not pressure me into a deal.\"\\n\\nThat was pretty much my experience when I bought a Honda at Martin about 15 years ago. The salesman I worked with (his name was Patrick) was just a pleasant guy who made the experience as pleasant and human as it could be. When we decided to buy a minivan, we went back to Martin, since our experience had been so good over a decade ago. \\n\\nThis time around it was a lousy experience.\\n\\nMy father and I went in about two weeks ago to test drive the 2018 Odyssey. Amir was our sales associate. He was pleasant enough on the test drive, but the second we entered the dealership he seemed to be doing everything in his power to live up to every negative stereotype of a car salesman. The pressure was absolutely absurd. Amir wanted us to buy the car. I get that. He wanted us to buy the car right then. I get that, too. But when we said for the eighth time that we were planning to test drive a Toyota before making a final decision, It would have been nice if he had respected that. Then he called in his manager Joe, who was somehow even more absurd. I think my favorite part is when we told Joe that we were interested in checking out Toyota\\'s all wheel drive model and he explained to us that the very fact that people buy cars that aren\\'t all wheel drive proves that no one needs this feature. Y\\'know-- just like the fact that some people buy briefs indicates that no one needs boxers. It was absurd.\\n\\nIn any case, Amir and Joe wanted us to buy the car right away, but they weren\\'t willing to make us an offer we couldn\\'t refuse. Instead they just tried to cajole us. Operating on the principle \"don\\'t make a huge purchase because two guys really want you to,\" we left to go check out the Toyota. (When we came out an employee from the service shop was leaning against my dad\\'s car while texting. Pretty obnoxious, but whatever.)\\n\\nTo make a long story somewhat shorter, we decided to buy the Odyssey and determined that Martin\\'s prices were more or less in line with what everyone else was offering. Since we needed the car quickly and were both very busy, we decided to just buy it at Martin. We went back that night at about half hour before closing and sealed the deal.\\n\\nImmediately after signing the papers, they start in on their next sale-- the extended warranty. Joe rather hilariously pivoted from telling us about what a great car it was to explaining how many systems in the car are prone to breaking. \"You see that key?\" he asked. \"That\\'s a $300 key!\" Boy, that sure made us feel great about our decision.\\n\\nWe were then ushered into an office where a man (Bob, I think) pointed to a piece of paper with a number of prices written in such a way so that the total was obscured. He pointed to one of the more expensive options and said \"This is the one people with kids buy.\" Well, no, Bob. That\\'s the one that people with kids who have done no research buy. We passed.\\n\\nWe agreed that I would pick up the car the next day at 3 PM after a meeting, but my meeting ended early. I gave Amir a call to see if it would work for him if I came by at 2 PM. Rather than just explaining that it wouldn\\'t be ready, Amir seemed miffed, but said it would be ready in 30 minutes. I showed up 35 minutes after that. Then I waited. And waited. And waited. I waited for another 45 minutes (past the time we had originally agreed on) before it was ready. According to our paperwork, the car should have had less than 5 miles on it. In fact, it was closer to 35. It\\'s really not a big deal, but it\\'s also not hard to get right. \\n\\nThe funny thing about all of this is that Amir and Joe were probably high-fiving over what a fantastic job they had done making the sale. In fact, we were 99% certain that we would be buying that car on that day at that dealership. These guys did everything in their power to make us question that decision. If I\\'m still living in the area when I buy my next car, I\\'ll consider a Honda, but I\\'ll look to other dealerships first. \\n\\n(The one star is for the fact that both Amir and Joe seemed to be aware of just how ridiculous they were being. Had this all been sincere, it would have been intolerable.)',\n",

Honestly, all the people that worked there looked like they hated life and it was the worst place in the world to work.  None of them smiled in the 1.5 hours I was there.  As far as the food, it was $4 for scrambled eggs and $1 for any add ons you want (ie spinach, onions, cheese, etc). Ok fine that's reasonable, but seriously it was the smallest portion ever and didn't even taste as good as homemade scrambled eggs.  Total let down.  I thought any place could make decent eggs, but apparently not.  I really wanted to like this place, but sadly was really let down.\",\n",

The waitress told us there was a new chef, and the menu was written on a board.  This really seemed promising.  The problems started when we ordered the hummus.  It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't very good.  It had a very canned taste, and there was just not enough tahini.  Canned beans are a-ok with me, but when that's all I can taste, it's sort of a problem.\\n\\nThen I ordered the frutti de mar....oh dear.  Big mistake.  I'm pretty weary of mussels at most places, but I usually like to give them the benefit of the doubt.  First off the red sauce & pasta were so oily.  I usually just let my nose tell me if the seafood is legit. I smelled 2 mussels and both smelled like baby diaper.  Gross!  I smelled a third one that smelled decent, so I ate it.  Wrong.  It still had a funky taste, like it was just bad.  Then I tried the scallops - the one I tried tasted very fishy.  I had my husband try it, thinking maybe I was just being too critical/crazy, and he had to spit it out.  Needless to say we stopped there.  We sent the dish back, and although the waitress was a little skeptical (meaning maybe the dish wasn't the problem), but she took care of it.  I ordered the appetizer squash ravioli instead.  It was incredibly oily & just tasted muddy.  My husband ordered the short ribs which he said tasted good, but there was quite a bit of connective tissue & gristle he had to wade through.\\n\\nI was pleased to find that the waitress did not charge us for the seafood pasta.  And all in all the service was pretty good - whenever the waitress got too busy the bartender would stop by, which was good.  I think we'll go back for the happy hour wine, but I'm not so sure we'll give them a second chance in the food arena.\",\n",

Every time I eat here the food has just been really disappointing and I consider myself pretty lenient when it comes to mexican food. I mean I'll eat almost anything. And I know I can't be the only one who feels unsatisfied by this place because I'm not even a terribly picky reviewer. \\n\\nMy top Mexican go-to list are usually: Carreta's Grill, Juan's Flying Burrito or Superior Grill. But I wanted to try something new. I've really TRIED to like this place. I have visited Casa Garcia maybe 3 times in the past year because it had this great reputation but I felt so disappointed every time and wanted to keep giving it another shot thinking maybe I was ordering the wrong things somehow. The queso is some sort of watered down cheese substance (and not like in a hot cheese kind of way, you could literally pour this stuff into your coffee like its a bowl of cream), the chili relleno had the same cheese inside it so that sort of turned me off, nachos are always soupy and soggy (even right when they get to the table), the fajitas are small, the rice is stale. I don't know I mean I just don't get anything out of this place and I happen to LOVE Mexican food! \\n\\nA friend of mine always gets the enchiladas and he swears by it so maybe that's what you need to get there. But I'd hate to try it for the fourth time only to be further disappointed. \\n\\nNot to mention the sanitation problem this place seems to have. You can tell they don't clean much, which to be fair, isn't some big requirement for me. There's plenty of hole in the wall shady looking places with great food right? But what I CAN'T ignore is the extremely dirty silverware. I mean there were GIANT obnoxious unmissable amounts of food caked onto my fork and knife from the last person. It looked like they didn't even bother soaking it in some hot sanitized water before throwing it in the dishwasher and baking it right on there. It was pretty gross. I jacked the silverware from the next table over but found the same thing. It took browsing through 3 different sets to find a suitable fork. I mean....c'mon that's just disturbing on so many levels....\\n\\nThe only reason this place really even gets 2 stars is because I've always had a pleasant experience if I JUST sit at the bar and drink a margarita. Their happy hour (2-4-1 margaritas) is a pretty solid deal and the complementary bean and salsa dip that comes with the chips are actually surprisingly decent! The bartender has always been really friendly and knowledgable about tequilas and we have a nice chat.\\n\\nHowever, you basically NEED to go visit the bar and drink your sorrows away after encountering the food there....\\n\\nSorry Casa Garcia, but we just aren't compatible.

He said that when you order online they have to transpose the order into their local system, and that is where the error occurred. Really? So he sent me another pizza.

       " {'text': 'WOW! Let me just start off by saying this place is packed or maybe it was just packed the Monday evening I was there. My husband and I were craving yummy pizza so we came across Pizzeria Vetri and decided to try it out. We had a choice of either waiting 30 minutes for a table that would basically be shared with other people or eating at the pizza bar right away. I didn\\'t mind watching the food get made. It was pretty cool in fact! We were offered sparkling or \"normal\" water and we chose the latter. \\nMy husband and I couldn\\'t find a pizza we both desired so we ordered two separate ones: the crudo and the salsiccia. We also ordered a Rotolo because every other table seemed to be ordering one and it looked delicious. To be honest, I think the Rotolo was my favorite perhaps because it was the first time I tried it. \\nNow back on topic, the pizza\\'s were edible. Were they delicious? Eh. My husband and I don\\'t exactly like vegetables. We never crave vegetables to be exact. However, while eating the pizza\\'s here, we were both wishing we ordered a salad. I\\'m not sure how to explain it but the food wasn\\'t exactly greasy but it felt that way. I wish they offered some pizza\\'s that had meat and vegetables on them. For example, a Prosciutto pizza with spinach and cherry tomatoes. Now that sounds delicious! \\nThe service was A-OK mostly due to being busy. We needed napkins but never got them. We also waited about five minutes for the check to come. The whole experience felt rushed because the restaurant was packed and busy. \\nAll in All, I don\\'t think I will be going back as I didn\\'t enjoy the experience or find the food worth $60 dollars.',\n",

The coupon touted a number of \"free services\" provided with an oil change. I didn\\'t get charged for any additional, but at least 2 of the services were poorly done or not done at all. On my receipt, it stated that cleaning exterior windows was done, but that was clearly not true considering the amount of bugs and dirt still on the windshield and other windows. Second, the windshield washer fluid was replaced with water. Finally, as soon as I leave my change oil light comes on. None of these are huge problems, but if they skipped that much that I can see, it makes me wonder what they skipped that I cannot see.

       " {'text': 'We were in Philly to participate in the recent Philadelphia Marathon and like every other runner in town, decided to have Italian for dinner ( carb-loading) . The management at Barra certainly did not know about the marathon and were not prepared for every seat in the house to be filled from 7-9pm. Originally reserved as a party of 4, we arrived 15 min early and requested to add 1 more seat for dinner and were told by the manager to sit at the bar and he ,\"hoped a table would open up for us\". My friends and I thought this was strange, as we knew they would just add one more seat to our original table ( which they did). Why make a big deal, Barra? Seating was an issue-note to anyone planning to eat here-the seating along the wall (leather lounge bench) has much less cushioning that expected..you drop down a few inches and it makes uncomfortable seating for dinner. You will need to sit at the very edge of the bench(wooden area) to be at the same level as those seated in chairs and to eat your meal. Our appetizer,Margherita Pizza,arrived in 20 min (a bit of a wait, but we understood they were busy) and was delicious. Our dinners arrived 30 min after we finished the pizza (obviously some grumbles here, hungry runners are not happy people) Dinner -Penne and Meatballs for me, Lasagna, Chicken Parm for others was underwhelming. MIne arrived cold and the meatballs were dry and tasteless. I hope next year Barra will be prepared for the arrival of carb-loading runners who love Italian cuisine pre-marathon, but we will be dining elsewhere.',\n",

A couple of days later I received a phone call from the \"Owner\", the franchisee I gather.

I trusted them largely based on these reviews, however, so I feel that I should share my experience.\\n\\nFirst off, they do beautiful body work, which is the reason they got two stars at all. Even the dealership has trouble matching my paint color, but Philadelphia Auto Body had no trouble making my car look like new. They also did a great job detailing the interior - it looked and smelled great when I got it back a month later.\\n\\nWhen I came to pick up the car, the back hubcap was still damaged from where it bounced off the curb. They claimed the insurance company didn\\'t believe it was related to the accident and wouldn\\'t pay for it. I was mad, but it was cosmetic and I\\'d been without my car for a month, so I just accepted it.\\n\\nI left and picked up my friend, and she immediately commented that the car was pulling to the left. I blamed the road, because I figured they JUST fixed it, that couldn\\'t be possible. I noticed it too, but I thought I was crazy. My mom told me to try driving it on different roads, different conditions, etc. Then my mom and cousin drove it, and both noticed it pulling. I called P.A.B. to let them know, and they tried to tell me that the damage was to the back end and that would have no effect on the front end, so it must have been pulling before. That is possibly the dumbest statement I\\'ve ever heard from someone who supposedly works on cars, because even I know that the back and front end are connected, and the car was definitely NOT pulling before the accident. Then he tried to tell me I must have hit a pothole and screwed up the alignment. I informed him I did not hit a pothole. Essentially, he didn\\'t believe me, and kept trying to convince me that I should have come back sooner, even though I explained that the reason I didn\\'t return sooner was because I TRUSTED THEIR WORK, and thought I was the crazy one. \\n\\nI told my mom, and she called the insurance company, and they agreed it could go back to the shop. She also mentioned the hubcap. The insurance company said that they had in fact paid for that to be repaired. P.A.B.\\'s excuse? \"They must have gotten confused about which vehicle it was for.\" Ok, fine, we\\'re all human and mistakes happen. My friend took the car in for me at 8am on her day off. They said it would be ready by 4, so she could pick me up from work. I called at 3, and they adjusted that to 4:30. It wasn\\'t done until around 6pm, and the issue was that the first time around they had \"forgotten\" a plastic part that the wheel needed. They also scratched up the back bumper while it was there, but I\\'d rather live with the damage than leave my car with them for another minute. \\n\\nLong story short: if all you need is body work, they will do a beautiful job on your car and you\\'ll be very pleased with the results. If you need anything mechanical done, go elsewhere, because in my personal experience they were disorganized and careless with that part of the repairs.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Well it\\'s been a while since I wrote a review and that\\'s partially because I went on vacation.  Now it\\'s time to review the main vehicle of that vacation: Carnival Cruise Lines....\\n\\nI have to say that I\\'m pretty disappointed in carnival.  There are a variety of reasons why and I\\'ll attempt to illustrate them fully below:\\n\\n1 - They charge you for Soda.   Yeah I know.  I mean seriously? Soda is like the cheapest thing in the world and you have the gall to charge me like 3 bucks for can of Coke?  Get off me.  Sure you have an \"unlimited plan\" but you\\'d need to drink soda like me in college to get your money\\'s worth.\\n\\n2 - Diamonds International. It\\'s really sad to me that Carnival has either purchased land or worked with each of the ports to create an identical mall at each port that contains not 1, not 2, but 3 freaking Diamonds Internationals at each location.  Then they drop you off and effectively hold you hostage in these cookie cutter malls shoving \"cheap\" jewelry, souveniers and lots of other \"americanized shit\" into your face.  I didn\\'t go Cozumel to get a t-shirt from Ron Jon Surf Shop, get a drink at Fat Tuesdays and buy diamonds.  I went to experience local culture and to lay on a beach.\\n\\n3 - Shore Excursions. Much like above, the cruise line makes it difficult for you to do anything without the purchase of a \"shore excursion\".    This includes laying on the beach.  Shockingly, at every port we are far away from the beach and to get there you generally need to take local transportation and/or buy an \"excursion\".  The excursion costs like $50 a person.  For the beach.  I mean cmon.  I\\'d say that\\'s a bit overkill.  Can I go to a local taxi and get there?  Generally yeah, but guess what?  Those dudes know that your only alternative is a $50 excursion and they price themselves accordingly.  Oh and most excursions start at 8 am. Totally not my thing.\\n\\n4 - Food.  I\\'ll be honest, I wasn\\'t impressed.  They have a ton of variety and the buffets and main dining room have reasonable hours.  But the buffet wasn\\'t as good as a nice Casino Buffet and the dining room food felt like food from an overly-produced wedding reception.  The steak house was \"ok\".  My jaunt over to Elways at Cherry Creek here in Denver with Ladyhawk for our anniversary was 10 times better on a pure food level.\\n\\nSo at this point you must be saying, \"geez Nick, you didn\\'t enjoy yourself on vacation!\"  You\\'d be wrong.  I loved spending a week relaxing, playing cards, reading and exploring new places with my wonderful wife.  It was a blast.  I\\'ll even try a cruise again someday, just not with Carnival.  \\n\\nThe hidden gem in our excursions and searching?  Isla Roatan in Honduras.  That place is very beautiful and Anthony\\'s Key Resort on that island is a place I\\'ll go back to sometime.  Gauranteed.',\n",

B to the S.  \\n\\nOther games do pay out better, but this arcade is nothing more than a mix of keep the younger kids busy type money pits and false hope \"cut the string for the iPad\" or other versions of the \"crane\" games that one might end up putting $20 into just to get a damned stuffed bear.  \\n\\nI didn\\'t have a chance to do the laser tag, so I could be missing quite a bit there.  Actually, the kids running around the place did seem to be having a good time.  I just cannot figure out why anyone would go there for anything other than the laser tag.  Bowling looked like any other bowling alley but for prices that aren\\'t even worth spending.  SIUE is just up the road and about half the price.  \\n\\nIn all, if you have kids, I\\'m sure Edison\\'s is going to end up on your list of places to go at some point or another, I just would highly encourage you to find a different option.  The games are over priced, with very little reward, and the pizza was good but nothing special.',\n",

We each got combination platters take out.  I got the gyro combination.  It came with a box that had veggies (lettuce, tomato, onions), gyro meat with tzatziki, as well as bread, a side of hummus, and a side of tabbouleh.  I will give it to them, a big portion.  I was actually confused whether I should use the bread and make a sandwich or use it for dipping in hummus.  With no other options for dipping I used the bread to dip in the hummus and ate the gyro and veggies on their own.  Unfortunately, I wasn't enthralled.  The gyro meat didn't taste very good, almost burnt, and the tzatziki didn't cover it up.   I guess it's a matter of taste, but the tabbouleh was so overwhelmingly filled with garlic that I couldn't eat it.  Even the bread was disappointingly very thin, not the nice thickness that I'm used to with pita.  I rarely leave a plate unfinished but I just coudn't do it with this one.  My girlfriend's platter was also disappointing as she only received two balls of falafel.  The hummus was the only saving grace,  The hummus was very good, and my girlfriend got a side of a different style of hummus that was amazingly tasty.  But, sadly, that only gives one extra star.  Because of the great reviews I may willing to go back another time and try something different.\",\n",

       " {'text': \"I went with a friend about 2 months ago and overall, we enjoyed it. This time, I went for a formal dinner with my family and it was a bad experience - none of us will ever return. \\n\\nTo start things off, we made reservations and were seated at the back of the restaurant where every 20-60 seconds, a door would slam. The heavy slam of the door was noticeably distracting and shook our booth! It would interrupt our conversation and made it difficult to enjoy our meal. So, we had to move tables. However, the waitress - who was less than friendly and outgoing and only grew more sour faced as the night continued - found it appropriate to then move us to a seat directly across the bar instead, without telling us where we were going first. This new seat was hardly better, though we supposed it was the lesser of two evils. \\n\\nAs the meal continued, we ordered lobster macaroni and the Asian shrimp for appetizers. Both were good, yet we did not get bread and butter until after our appetizers were served and cleared from our table, which we found to be a little odd. Usually, bread and butter comes first, doesn't it? Though it was not too big of a deal in and of itself, it only reflected on how unorganized and out of sorts the waitstaff seemed. \\n\\nWe ordered our mains, and here is where things became even more problematic. One member of the party ordered filet with potato and green beens, and the beans were crunchy and uncooked, the potatoes dry, and the filet very fatty. Later when our extremely pleasant waitress returned with her typically less than interested attitude to our table, we expressed our concern about the filet and vegetable plate when she asked how the food was...yet she barely reacted with more than an annoyed 'sorry', as if we had done something wrong. If a waitress is going to inquire about the meal but then does not do anything for her displeased customer, why even bother asking in the first place, I wonder...?\\n\\nI ordered lobster with corn and potatoes, and this was my first time ordering a real lobster dish. I had tried lobster previously and loved it; I figured if Docs is supposed to be an esteemed seafood restaurant, why not try a classic dish? However, for such an expensive plate, I was extremely disappointed. My 35 dollar entree came served without anything to crack the shell and no cocktail fork; another waiter helping the waitress serve acted annoyed when asking for utensils and a plate (can you see a theme here? The waitstaff is either overworked or simply unfriendly!); and the lobster was EXTREMELY tough and chewy, to the point where I was unable to cut it properly, if at all, and it tasted disgusting! Lobster is mild, but it is NOT supposed to be tough and 100% flavorless. I was very displeased. A new waitress I had to flag down appeared vexed though tried to help me. Then, someone - presumably the manager - came instead of our original server and we were told a new lobster plate would be served 'in just a few moments'...yet even after having the chef come out to reassure us, I did not receive my new lobster until 10:05 PM. I waited well over half of an hour for the new lobster plate. Admittedly, I was slightly pissed when our original waitress came out with the lobster just as we were getting ready to leave, and asked if she could box it up. I felt like telling her to take the box and shove it!\\n\\nIt was simply because by that point, we were very tired and tired of being at the restaurant where things had gone from bad to worse. After having at least four different waiters, three of which were aloof and annoyed, and terrible service along with mediocre food, we wanted OUT. Thankfully, the lobster was taken off of the bill, yet for a less than satisfactory evening we paid close to 80 dollars. \\n\\nThe bottom line: Do not waste your time at this restaurant. Food is a hit or a miss, unpredictable quality and service! There is NO consistency with service and food at Doc Magrogans. Please save your time and money and go to a refutable and classy restaurant such as McCormick and Shmicks or someplace else decent. This restaurant is best for those who want to mess around at the bar and order apps vs. for a group or party coming for a nice lunch/dinner. (And on a final note, I feel it's good to mention that if you're looking to be able to hear by the end of the night, AVOID AVOID AVOID.)\",\n",

We arrived at 5:45 -- pretty early for dinner -- and were told a 20-30 minute wait, which turned into a 45 minute wait.  That should have been our first sign something was amiss.  After waiting 45 minutes, we already knew what we wanted to order, so ordered immediately after being seated at 6:30.  We ordered a chicken salad, a burger, a wrap, boneless wings, and a kids mini corn dogs.  60 minutes later we finally got our food.  Our waitress was great, and came by every 10 minutes to ask if we needed anything (other than our food), but all she could say is it should be coming, it should be coming.  We asked if the order was lost, and she said she saw it up on the screen in the kitchen, and said she had confirmed the kitchen had seen it, and that the screen shows them how long a order has gone unfilled, so they should know it had been an hour.  She had even talked with the manger.  Despite this, it took a full 60 minutes to bring out 6 items which literally have 5 minute prep time.  The chicken on the salad, wrap, and wings had all been precooked and heated under a heat lamp -- they were all dry.  They also put dressing on the salad despite asking for it on the side.  The waitress insisted on the manager coming over to us.  She asked him several times.  He finally came over as we were trying to leave, and said \"what is the problem\" curtly as if the waitress hadn\\'t already told him 10 times, before, during, and after our meal was delayed an hour.  When my 74 year old mother politely told him (remember, the waitress asked him to come over, not us), he replied \"did everything come out ok?\" as if the only thing that mattered was did we receive edible food or not after waiting 1 hour and 45 minutes.  The guy acted exasperated, like the whole thing was out of his control.  Dude, I hate to break it to you, but your the manager.  This place is bleeding money -- if you can\\'t get food out in under an hour, you can\\'t turn tables.  The faster you turn tables, the more customers you can serve, and the more money you make.  Also, the less the wait time, so less customers get frustrated and leave and are less likely to come back.  With an hour wait for food, less customers are going to come back again, including us.

I never would have had the extra charge if she had told me about the parking garage in the first place!\\n\\nShe also told me that yes the person from the conference had stopped by the front desk,to confirm the conference was covering the room. But, she said that I would still need to stop by the front desk AGAIN in the morning to check with the hotel's conference person who would come in and I needed to take it up with her. seriously?\\n\\nIt's really frustrating - for a hotel this nice they ought to check that all front desk people are well trained.\",\n",

       " {'text': 'Let me first mention that Penca is one of our favorite restaurants in Tucson. We eat there often and take out of town visitors there, too. So yesterday (5/4/2017) my husband and I took a visitor, whom we had told before in glowing terms about the outstanding food and the great cocktails to Penca for dinner. Imagine our utter disappointment and embarrassment when we experienced a complete breakdown of the kitchen - and the bar. First, they were out of three items we tried to order, and that was just us. But okay, can happen, no big deal. However every single dish we were actually able to order, was tasteless and just not up to their usual level. As a starter we ordered the guacamole y salsa. The guacamole was bland and gooey, no lime juice, cilantro etc. There was also a little bowl of cubed tasteless tomatoes - don\\'t know what that was supposed to be, pico de gallo? No onions, cilantro, peppers, lime juice anywhere to be found. The third little bowl contained some green tasteless sauce - tomatillo salsa?  The menu states \"topped with queso fresco\" - nowhere to be seen. \\nThe tacos which are usually outstanding were a huge disappointment. The tortillas were soggy and fell apart, instead of rolling them up and eating them with your fingers you had to eat them with knife and fork, because they broke down into pieces. Maybe there were one or two nopalitos in the nopales taco, but mostly red cabbage. The guajolote contained hard dried pieces of turkey. Chipotle cream?, green onions? Nothing. The Mancha Manteles was more or less okay, except the pork chop was a bit on the dry side and so were the masa cakes, not much mole there, too. Maybe they ran out of the moles, cilantro and limes, too. \\nWe finished with the usually great churros, which were - you guessed it - not fluffy with a crunchy crust, but one was overcooked, the other undercooked. \\nWe had told our visitor, that Penca is one of the best places for good cocktails. But not only was the kitchen in disarray, but there seems to have been no professional bartender around either, even though plenty of people were standing behind the bar - perhaps to many? Maybe they ran out of tequilas and mezcals, too, because our cocktails (all five of them) contained so little alcohol they were completely unbalanced -  basically sugar water. Very embarrassing to have described those as some of the best cocktails in Tucson. These days, where one can find fantastic cocktails in great restaurants and bars it is surprising to be confronted which such unambitious (or inexperienced) bartenders who honestly should be ashamed to push an unbalanced ten dollar glass of sugar water on the customer. Two stars, because the ambience and the server were still great, but the kitchen and bar deserve zero.\\n\\nI took the time to write this review, because I don\\'t want Penca to go downhill like so many other restaurants in Tucson which started out great and for some reason became mediocre and eventually had to close. I certainly hope this was a one time incident. Please get your act together, don\\'t cut corners and hire experienced, intelligent chefs, and bartenders.',\n",

Our waitress name aeriella(don't know how to spell name), was the worst waitress we ever had at this restaurant. She had a bad attitude and the service was horrible. We ordered the appetizers. We all thought it was pretty good. Our waitress never came over to see if we needed anything or ask how was everything or are we doing ok. She back over when it was time to order the entree. We ordered our entrees and our table was never cleared off until it was close to the time for our food to come out. Everytime we asked her any kind of questions, she gave off a bad attitude. It's not like we were rude towards her. Now to the food. None of us enjoyed our entrees; well I didn't even get an entree because I was frustrated. I ordered a ribeye and for $30, I wasn't expecting a thin and small piece of steak. I've been to steakhouses in new york and even chophouse, so I wasn't expecting for it to be that size for that price, but I was expecting it to be a little bit thicker than what I received. I told the waitress and she gave me another attitude and asked what I wanted. As I was telling her what I wanted she was walking away before I could finish the order. I ordered the garlicky shrimp pasta and the sauce came out watery and I had two whole shrimp that was sliced in half, which made it look real curly. They must have ran out of shrimp I couldn't believe the kitchen staff could send something out like that. So, I also sent that back and didn't order anything else. Our waitress sort of snatched the plate away with an attitude. I left without eating any entrees. My family didn't even finish their food. They only ate some of it because they were hungry. When they got home, they just threw their food away. They also, felt that they would've had better at cheesecake factory. When it was time to pay for the food, our waitress was never to be found. My husband had to ask another waiter to get her. The servers that brought the food out was more polite even the waiter that went to get her. I wished we had him. The food and the service was one of the worst experiences we ever had at grandlux. Even the manager didn't come over to apologize for the inconvenience or see if we needed anything.

I then ordered macaroni & cheese, and it was cold. I kindly told my server who was extremely attentive and great and he got it out of my way. He brought a new order of mac & cheese out, and it was the right temperature but there was shredded pork inside. I had one of my coworkers try it, and they confirmed it was salty pork. It smelled of pork. As a vegetarian, I quickly lost my appetite and had it returned. The manager came out and assured me I was wrong about the pork and that it was the rind on the gouda. The manager also told me they don't even have pork on the menu, but I looked and they had a crispy pork option as well as a charcuterie board. My coworker corrected him about telling me I was wrong, and the manager stuttered and said he checked with the chef and it wasn't pork. It looks to me like they reused a utensil to heat up my mac. I told him I didn't want anything else. Then, he brings out a salad from their other restaurant which completely confused me because I just finished eating a salad. I didn't touch it, and I was over the experience. I paid for my brussel sprout salad, tipped my server, and left for good.\",\n",

Why would I want to do that when I've reached the front?  Also, when I got to the front of the line, there were three open check-in stations right in front of me with no one manning them. They only had a few people checking us in when there was a long line and clearly they had the capacity to add staff to this area.  The prices are ridiculous.  My club sandwich and diet coke was $30.  If you want wine, prepare to spend $12-14 per glass. This place is also very large and confusing to navigate.  It's worse at night because it gets dark inside and there is NO ONE around to help you.  All the storefronts are closed and there is literally not one soul that you could ask for directions.  They claim to be a high-end, more fancy hotel, but this place is the pits.  I wouldn't return nor would I recommend it. I recommend staying downtown where you are close to good food and other amenities.\",\n",

The price was $29, you could not drive a cart off the path, the fairways looked great, obviously soaked in water for the over seeding, and the greens were effectively sand mats. To start they placed a single behind our party of 4 so we immediately had to let the individual behind us play through. All of this was fine until the sprinklers began pumping water into our round. Again, I know that they were over seeding, but we and many others were on the course when sprinklers kicked into full swing behind, ahead, and on top of us. Literally, we were surprise sprayed by popping sprinklers. Let\\'s be clear here, I am not a professional greens keeper, and I do not claim to be an expert in watering of grass in a desert environment, but when people are playing through the course I feel it\\'s fair that the sprinklers are monitored to allow their patrons to enjoy the experience. To finish this off, I am writing this review not because of the conditions, but because of the unacceptable courtesy of the two individuals in the proshop. After being unceremoniously assaulted by the surprise sprinkler attack, I went into the proshop commenting \"Hey, we were playing on the course and the sprinklers, not only prevented us from playing the round, they sprayed us\" (with what I assume to be reclaimed water, no fun). The more senior individual looked at me with an attitude and simply said \"Well that\\'s over seeding, their going all day, we tried to warn you\" (while holding up the, carts on path only - reseeding sign). The whole experience was low, but these guys topped it off. I have zero interest in going back to this middle of nowhere course.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Fair warning, this is gonna be a long one, involving multiple locations and Southwest\\'s \"Customer Service\".  \\n\\nI was heading out this past Thursday to make my cousin\\'s HS graduation in east TX.  My first warning this would be the trip from hell was a text warning me of a delay in Tucson (TUS).  I live an hour & a half east of TUS, but decided to leave the house as originally planned to ensure I could speak to a gate agent.  \\n\\nMy layover was to be 45 minutes in Denver, yet the delay was already 55 minutes due to weather according to the SW gate agent in TUS.  I was quickly informed I wouldn\\'t make my Denver (DEN) departure.  What ensued was a crazy spider web of options having me fly to LAX, staying overnight in DEN, flying to Houston, then Dallas Love Field (DAL), my final destination...arriving at 5:45pm, with a 7pm graduation to make two hours away.  No Go!  Finally the gate agent said, \"Can you drive to Phoenix?...there\\'s a flight leaving at 7:40pm.\"  Realizing I had a nearly two hour drive, she quickly changed my flight & I hauled butt off-site to pick up my car & drive to PHX. \\n\\nDuring the drive I realized the gate agent hadn\\'t rescheduled my return flight & my car would be parked in PHX.  I quickly parked at the closest lot so I could speak to a gate agent, the parking later costing me $75 for a three day stay.  I stood for 45 minutes while the poor gate agent, Nancy, tried every way she could to reschedule my return flight so I could reunite with my car.  The system repeatedly gave her error messages & she couldn\\'t even check in a stroller for two dazed parents.  All her calls to her supervisor yielded no physical response.  Nancy did her best, calling everyone she could & finally informed me \"for future reference, ensure the original agent changes your return flight too.\"  A tad too late in this instance & I just had to board the plane, resorting to a Facebook post that yielded a possible ride from TUS to get my car in PHX, something I didn\\'t want to use.  Nancy entered some notes & told me to call the 1-800-I-FLY-SWA customer service number to reschedule once in Texas.   Sadly, this was the tip of the iceberg.  \\n\\nThe flight, pilots & flight attendants were wonderful.  I arrived 55 minutes later than my original flight, thankful the rental car company was still available.  What was terrible was the website & lack of customer service at FLY SWA.   Over two days I called eight times, spending a total of 4 hours, 18 minutes & 49 seconds desperately trying to get a human on the line.  As a tip - SW get some decent Muzak!  I stayed up til 4am freaking out because no one would respond, despite two messages saying I would get a call back in 15 minutes and 7 minutes, respectively.  I made two Facebook posts, even messaging them, with FB communications rep Lindsey no help.  During one hour+ session on hold I did a Google search & discovered that SW\\'s website had gone into \"meltdown\" & their phone lines were overwhelmed due to their recent low fare sale.\\n\\nSure enough, I checked the website, & was booted off repeatedly.  I was in full-on panic now because it showed I had no upcoming flights, listing my departure was on my original TUS flight, with my return the rescheduled flight out of PHX - stupid considering this would\\'ve meant that I was in the air at the same time on two separate flights!  It was a very sleepless night imagining I was going to have to book another very expensive, short-notice, flight just to get back to my car. \\n\\nFinally my cousin said \"to hell with SW, let\\'s go to Walmart & buy some wine!\"  Once again, I was on the phone, on hold buying a kiddie pool & booze when an angel named Rhonda finally answered.  24 minutes later I finally had a direct return flight to PHX, with a three hour drive home when I returned.\\n\\nI have always loved the flight crews & agents at SW.  I love that they give snacks on the plane & their in-flight cocktails are reasonably priced.  But this was a very stressful \"adventure\" I don\\'t ever want to repeat.  After all was said & done, Rhonda informed me I somehow have a miraculous credit of $133 I must use in the next two months.  I am searching for a brave soul to purchase the ticket for since I really don\\'t want to fly SW ever again.  Sadly, SW is typically more expensive than other carriers, particularly since I rarely need to check a bag, & if I do, it\\'s always free since I\\'m in the military. In addition, there\\'s no assigned seating for the extra cost.  (As a comedian once said \"Ever fly Southwest?...One thru Forty...GO!!!\")  I might also add that most other carriers will let military pre-board, while Southwest does not.  \\n\\nI sincerely hope my experience this past weekend was a rare one & dedicated flyers fare better than I.',\n",

It was difficult to move our party to the seats, and even more difficult to use the facilities and eventually leave - especially with a car seat and three little ones in tow.  If you have small children, car seats, wheelchairs, etc. - ask to sit in the area where you enter; the most space to move about is there.\\n\\nThe food came out slow - almost an hour.  The hash browns were cold.  The bacon was limp, with one near-raw - and we had specifically asked for crisp bacon when we ordered.  We were missing a glass of milk.  We were short silverware, napkins, and syrup.  We had three orders of pancakes on the table with no syrup.  Odd, for a pancake house.\\n\\nMy wife and I each had eggs benedict - very average.  One of the poached eggs was overcooked, and the other was under cooked.  I tried a little of everything on the table - from omelets to biscuits and gravy to pancakes - and it was all very, very average.  I was excited and happy to see another breakfast spot pop up close to the house, but we won't be returning.  For our money, we'll go somewhere else or simply eat at home.\",\n",

It was a solid neighborhood hang out with great service, good and fairly priced food and a nice patio. In the past few months I've been to this location which is close to our house and also to the Brentwood location (I had not been for months due to the traffic etc in Sylvan Park.) The first time back at Murphy Road was when they were trying their new model with actual servers waiting tables. We arrived at our table which had not been wiped down at all and there were several long hairs on the table. Appetite gone right there but since I was meeting a friend I stuck around. When the server finally arrived she was a complete space cadet and rude on top of that. My friend arrived, we ordered and the food they brought out was borderline cold (tacos, brisket and bbq) and what meat was inside was overcooked. We were short on time so I just paid and left. My next visit was to the Brentwood location. This time we sat at the bar, again borderline rude service and the food was also overcooked. I decided then that I wasn't going back until last night when my and I didn't have time to cook and she told me she wanted tacos. I called in our order and they told me it would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived on time and went to the bar to get our order. When the bartender finally decided to engage me I was told it was not ready. I waited another 10 mins and my food came out. Again overcooked and by the way I paid $31 for 5 bad tacos and a couple of sides. I really hate that what used to be such a well-run neighborhood place has become another typical, over priced trendy place run by people who obviously have no experience in the service industry. It's unfortunate and seems to be happening all over Nashville. I think I heard a rumor that LT was bought some time ago so maybe that has something to do with the decline.

I just can not bring myself to go back for fear of getting the same guy and having this experience all over again. \\n\\n    Here is the breakdown:  First, he took forever to come to our table and even take our drink order.  I was about to get up and leave.  It had been at least ten or fifteen minutes before he ever acknowledged us at the table and the place wasn\\'t even crowded!  It was a weeknight.

Anyway, this guy finally takes our order and then takes another ten minutes to bring me my water and then starts to walk off again.  I tell him that I would like to order.  I tell him which burger I want and that I want it to be a turkey burger, and with no mayo.  He looks really confused and takes about 3 minutes to write that down.  Then he repeats the name of the burger.  I say, \"Yes, with turkey and no mayo please.\"  He starts writing again for what seems like forever and then my boyfriend tries to order.  Then he starts to walk away and my boyfriend says, \"I\\'d like it medium-well, please.\"  He looked confused and was like, \"oh...\"   Then he asked me, \"How about you?  Medium well?\"  I said, \"Mine is turkey, so I would like that cooked properly please.\"  He said, \"Well, they\\'re going to ask me how you like it cooked.\"  I said, \"165 degrees please, which is the temperature turkey should be cooked to in order to be cooked properly.\"  He tried to argue with me about it and then kind of laughed and walked away.  That is a health hazard under-cooking poultry!   What is wrong with this guy?  I don\\'t think this guy knew anything about food or had ever waited tables in his life.\\n\\n    Then, I finally get my food thirty minutes later and it is slathered in mayonnaise. I try to get his attention for a while, but he ignores me, and I am so hungry at this point and this want to leave this place because this guy is annoying me that I just rip the top half off, wipe it off with my napkin and try to eat part of it.  He comes back about 20 minutes later when I\\'m about done and was like oh was it good.  I told him about the mayo and he said, \"Well, I didn\\'t know that.\"  Then he just walked away!  Weird! He didn\\'t say he was sorry and acted like it was my fault even though I\\'d repeated it twice when I ordered!  So rude too!  Finally, we couldn\\'t get him to bring the check and had to flag him down again.  I thought I would never get out of that place!  It was the worst service I have received in a very long time.  Although I enjoy Red Robin\\'s turkey burger, this service really turned me off to the place.  A lot of time will have to pass before I consider giving it a go again, if I ever do.',\n",
